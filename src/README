1. The code is written by python (v 2.75) in Mac Maverick.
2. Except potential.py which I use as utilities, other files are all problem targeted, which you can run through command line directly (they are executable files). Specifically, which problem a file targets is clearly shown by its name.
3. You should put 'data' folder and 'model' folder at the same directory with 'src'
4. If you have meet any problems, please contact with me: dennywu@cs.umass.edu
